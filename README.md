This is an example of simple tracking using OpenCV. 

How to? (Setting up environment)
- Download python 3.9.0 for your respective OS from here (https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-390/)
- Before installing make sure you check "Add python to path" if asked.


How to? (Running the code)
- Clone this repository or download main.py file.
- Right click main.py file and run it with python.
- It will ask you for video source. If you want to use your webcam enter 0 otherwise enter full path to your video.
- Hit enter and it will start showing the video source you selected, press "S" and it will stop.
- Draw a rectangle around anything you want to detect and it will start detecting it.

NOTE: This example uses OpenCv trackers which might get outperformed by machine learning trackers like DeepSORT. For more accuracy use dedicated trackers. Feel free to use the code!
